An easy to use wordpress plugin,where admin can configure a urls to open as popunder in visitor browser upon visitor click, with Cookie Support.

== Description ==

Acurax on click pop under plugin allows administrator to configure a website urls in the plugin settings..which will open as **pop under** on visitors browser.

A Quicklook

	★ Now you can configure multiple URLS
	
	★ Can set pop under repeat repeat interval

	
Pop Under will open when visitor clicks on the website. When popup is triggered, Plugin will save a cookie in visitors browser to remember that popup is triggered, and so it will not open again until it reaches the configured timeout interval.

It will open only once per cookie session. There is also option to configure the **cookie timeout**.

**For example** If we set cookie time out to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">60 minutes</span>, Pop under will open on visitors click only with an interval of 60 minutes.</div>
